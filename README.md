[![SAY NO TO THE TRADEMARK POLICY ](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/blyxyas/8f17fbe1cafdeff65bbe6b332d4f4723/raw/715a24df3ad74b838c6b0ff8079d3f7f9172b0db/banner.svg)](https://github.com/blyxyas/no-rust-policy-change)

This README.md is **not endored** by the Rust Foundaton, all keywords related to Rust are a [*reference to a city in the Austrian state of Burgenland, located on the western shore of Lake Neusiedl near the border with Hungary. With only about 1,900 inhabitants, it is the country's smallest statutory city, as it was endowed with the rights of a royal free city by the Hungarian crown in 1681*](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust,_Burgenland).

Mentions of "Rust" in any programming related content I've published either means that the code is inspired by people living in Rust, Burgenland (Austria), or is written in the beautiful countryside of Rust. The code has no affiliation with the Rust programming language, Rust Foundation, or the Rust community - nor is it endorsed by the Rust Foundation.

Thank you.
