A secondary schoool student in Hong Kong, "going down the rabbit hole" of the programming world.

### About Me
- UK immigrant (Previously living in Hong Kong);
- Rust is my favourite programming language tho I sometimes code in JavaScript if nessessary;
- My favourite text editors are VS Code and NeoVim (Currently learning how to use);
- I prefer open source projects and software as proprietary software is often spying on you;
- I daily drive Arch Linux with KDE Plasma but I sometime use Windows 10 for video editing;
- I think IDEs are overkill for programming so I like to use text editors instead;
- I like to play Minecraft and only Minecraft (1.8 > 1.9);
- Currently working on [youtube-tui](https://github.com/siriusmart/youtube-tui) (written in Rust);
